First of all an embedded system is that system which has computer hardware with software embedded in it.
An Embedded System is controlled by an internal microprocessor or microcontroller instead of an external
control unit.Think of anything that provides you with programmable options. Any electronic system that 
allows users to interact, provides options for configuring behavior,is an embedded system.


These are some of the basic embedded systems that i found in my daily routine:

Digital Camera
Automated Teller Machine(ATM)
Calculator
Digital Watch
Security Camera
Washing Machine
Smart Phone
Telephone
Traffic Signals
Vending Machines

And list will go on.
